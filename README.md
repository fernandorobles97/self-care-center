# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
[//]: <>  
The Self Care Center is an app designed for users who are seeking motivation or a pick-me-up through their day-to-day life. The user is presented with a choice between receiving a mantra or an affirmation message, and once a selection has been made, a random message will display. If the user receives a message they don't want to see again, they have the choice to delete the message and are alerted that they won't see that message again.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> 
Utilizing CSS and HTML were the prioritized learning goals for this project and the ones that provided the most difficulty.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> 
Figuring out how to utilize CSS better and how to approach all the different styles and properties there was a difficult challenge that I'm proud I was able to solve. Refactoring the functions in JS to be more aligned with SRP was a task I was able to work through sooner than I thought. The biggest challenge was trying to figure out how to make my page match the comp and this was due to the struggles I faced with CSS and HTML. With help from other students and the lessons, I was able to become more comfortable navigating these languages.
